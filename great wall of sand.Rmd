The **Great wall of sand** is a name used by some of the media, (and this webpage), for a series of land reclamation projects on seven reefs in the Spratly islands area of the South China Sea undertaken by the *People's Republic of China (PRC)* since late 2013 - in order to strengthen PRC territorial claims to the region demarcated by the *Nine-dash line*.    

**Taiping Island** is an island administered by the *Republic of China (ROC)*. It is part of the *Tizard Bank (Zheng He Reefs)*. It is named Taiping (literally: "peace island") in honor of a Nationalist Chinese Navy warship which sailed to the island when Japan surrendered after the Second World War.
